        Create a new HTML document with a single <canvas> element in it,
         as well as a <script> tag where we query the canvas element.  
    -->
    <canvas width="512" height="512"></canvas>

    <script type="module">
      const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");

      //   Inform the user if WebGPU is unavailable by having the page fall back to a mode that doesn't use WebGPU.
      if (!navigator.gpu) {
        throw new Error("WebGPU not supported on this browser.");
      }

      //   The first step in initializing WebGPU for your app is to request a GPUAdapter.
      //   You can think of an adapter as WebGPU's representation of a specific piece of GPU hardware in your device.
      const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
      if (!adapter) {
        throw new Error("No appropriate GPUAdapter found.");
      }

      //   Once you have an adapter, the last step before you can start working with the GPU is to request a GPUDevice.
      //   The device is the main interface through which most interaction with the GPU happens.
      const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

      //   Now that you have a device, there's one more thing to do if you want to use it to show anything on the page:
      //   configure the canvas to be used with the device you just created.
      const context = canvas.getContext("webgpu");
      const canvasFormat = navigator.gpu.getPreferredCanvasFormat();
      context.configure({
        device: device,
        format: canvasFormat,
      });

      //   Now that you have a device and the canvas has been configured with it, you can start using the device to change the content of the canvas.
      //   To start, clear it with a solid color.
      //   In order to do that—or pretty much anything else in WebGPU—you need to provide some commands to the GPU instructing it what to do.
      //   To do this, have the device create a GPUCommandEncoder, which provides an interface for recording GPU commands.
      const encoder = device.createCommandEncoder();

      //   Get the texture from the canvas context you created earlier by calling context.getCurrentTexture(),
      //   which returns a texture with a pixel width and height matching the canvas's width and height attributes and the format specified when you called context.configure().
      //   You also have to specify what you want the render pass to do with the texture when it starts and when it ends:
      //   - A loadOp value of "clear" indicates that you want the texture to be cleared when the render pass starts.
      //   - A storeOp value of "store" indicates that once the render pass is finished you want the results of any drawing done during the render pass saved into the texture.
      const pass = encoder.beginRenderPass({
        colorAttachments: [
          {
            view: context.getCurrentTexture().createView(),
            loadOp: "clear",
            clearValue: [0, 0, 0.4, 1], // rgba
            storeOp: "store",
          },
        ],
      });

      //   Once the render pass has begun you do... nothing!
      //   At least for now. The act of starting the render pass with loadOp: "clear" is enough to clear the texture view and the canvas.
      //   End the render pass by adding the following call immediately after beginRenderPass()
      pass.end();

      //   It's important to know that simply making these calls does not cause the GPU to actually do anything.
      //   They're just recording commands for the GPU to do later.
      //   In order to create a GPUCommandBuffer, call finish() on the command encoder.
      //   The command buffer is an opaque handle to the recorded commands.
      const commandBuffer = encoder.finish();

      //   Submit the command buffer to the GPU using the queue of the GPUDevice.
      //   The queue performs all GPU commands, ensuring that their execution is well ordered and properly synchronized.
      //   The queue's submit() method takes in an array of command buffers, though in this case you only have one.
      device.queue.submit([commandBuffer]);

      //   Once you submit a command buffer, it cannot be used again, so there's no need to hold on to it.
      //   If you want to submit more commands, you need to build another command buffer.
      //   That's why it's fairly common to see those two steps collapsed into one, as is done in the sample pages for this codelab:
      //   https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#2
      device.queue.submit([encoder.finish()]);
